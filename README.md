This is the first project of the 42 core curriculum.

Libft is a library consisting of functions written in C, that are requested by the school subject's pdf.
Many of the functions are mimicking functions available in man, such as strlen (->ft_strlen).
This project is a solid introduction into C programming for beginners.

Everything is written according to the 42 school's rules (norminette).
